Atleast one ofthe operands has to be an user defined type
. :: sizeof typeid .* ?: CANNOT be overloaded 


Among the operators that can be overloaded in C++ are these:

arithmetic operators: + - * / % and += -= *= /= %= (all binary infix); + - (unary prefix); ++ -- (unary prefix and postfix)
bit manipulation: & | ^ << >> and &= |= ^= <<= >>= (all binary infix); ~ (unary prefix)
boolean algebra: == != < > <= >= || && (all binary infix); ! (unary prefix)
memory management: new new[] delete delete[]
implicit conversion operators
miscellany: = [] -> ->* , (all binary infix); * & (all unary prefix) () (function call, n-ary infix)
